Consolidating mining claims is key to shareholder value
Investors in exploration companies should realize that a major mining company considering the buyout of a junior is much less likely to be interested if the land package is an unconsolidated mix of patented and unpatented mining claims. That also means that some of the more interesting projects today have been underexplored due to fragmented claim status and a lack of historical data.
“Consolidation is the key to unlocking shareholder value in a mineral land package,” notes Jerry Baughman, president of Nevada Select Royalty, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ely Gold & Minerals (TSXV:ELY). Jerry is a veteran geologist with over 30 years’ experience working in the United States, Mexico and South America. Nevada Select maintains one of the largest mineral databases on Nevada properties and specializes in consolidating claims and data of underexplored projects.
“If there’s little isolated parcels of third-party claims, you want to tie those up; especially before you get too far down the road. If you think you’ve got a discovery you plan to develop, the longer you take to acquire the claims, the more it’s going to cost you,” explains Baughman, referring to third-party claim owners bidding up the cost of the claims as successful nearby exploration makes them more valuable. Likewise, if the third party is a major gold producer, the cost of consolidation automatically increases.
